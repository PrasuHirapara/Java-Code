Graph : Network of Nodes.

Node is also known as Vertex.
Connection between two pint is known as Edge.
Edge weight :Information about some physical quantity i.e. Time,dist,Speed .

Undirected : Does not have direction on weight.
Unidirectional graph : One direction.
Bidirectional : Multi directional.

Weighted : Graph which contains Weight.
Un- Weighted : Graph which does not contain Weight

Storing graph :
    1. Adjacent List ( List of list )
    2. Adjacent Matrix.
    3. Edge List.
    4. 2-D Matrix ( Implicit Graph )
